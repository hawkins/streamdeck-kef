# KEF Streamdeck Plugin - UNOFFICIAL

Works on mac. Currently not working for windows - i'll figure it out soon

Uses a global settings object to store the IP of the speakers. If you set 1 button's IP, they're all set. 

**Note**:  Only 1 computer on the network can use this plugin because KEF speakers only accommodate a single socket connection at a time.

# Structure

The plugin is a compiled node.js application since opening a socket is required. Binary is compiled using the pkg package.
